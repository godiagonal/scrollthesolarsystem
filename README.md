# Scroll the Solar System

An interactive model of the solar system made with JavaScript.
Visit the live site at [scrollthesolarsystem.com](#).

It has a bird's eye view of what our solar system looks like today according to
NASA's calculations and allows the user to scroll through the solar system and 
explore all major bodies in detail.

Planetary data is fetched from [NASA Horizons Web API](http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi)
once a month and scroll animations are done with [ScrollMagic](#) and [TweenMax](#).

Graphics are partially taken from [this icon pack](#) and the rest I have designed myself.

See you in space!
